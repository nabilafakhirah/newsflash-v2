<h3 align="center">An Android News Application</h3>
<br/>

## About
An improved version of my initial program [Newsflash](https://github.com/nabilafakhirah/newsflash). Most notable differences would be:
- Converted from Groovy to Kotlin DSL with Gradle Plugin
- Added a UseCase layer to the program
- Added the ability to locally store your favorite news. You can also delete them from your bookmarks!
- Added bottom navigation bar for clearer navigation to bookmarks

## What was used
This app was developed using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, NewsAPI.org, and also MVVM design pattern.

## How to use
- Clone the repository and add your NewsAPI.org API key into the local.properties file as shown below
```
API_KEY=1111xxxxxxx
```
- After that you should be able to run the program without a hassle
